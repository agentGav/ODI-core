# Mission

The Open Data Institute will catalyse the evolution of open data culture to create economic, environmental, and social value. We will;

1. unlock supply and demand, and communicate this value to address local and global issues.
1. convene, and collaborate with, world-class experts to incubate start-ups, train and mentor people, and nurture innovation.
1. create and disseminate knowledge to help anyone to learn and engage with open data, and enable them to scale.
